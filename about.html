       <p> For my first project in the web design class, I created an "About Us" page for the L & V Learning and Vitality Organization, which aims to help individuals find value in life through education. The organization provides support both through social media and in-person community programs. This page serves to communicate the organization's purpose while showcasing the skills I've learned in the class.

        In this project, I used HTML to structure the content across several pages, including the index.html, About Us, and Contact Us pages. The Contact Us page features a form that allows users to reach out to the organization directly. After a user submits the form, a success message appears, confirming that their submission was received. This functionality was achieved using basic HTML form elements and a simple interaction model.
        
        I also employed CSS in two separate stylesheets—one for layout and the other for styling. The layout stylesheet made use of Flexbox to ensure a responsive design that adjusts neatly across various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. The style sheet focused on aesthetics, using color schemes, fonts, and animations to enhance the user experience without overwhelming the content. I used CSS animations to create smooth transitions for buttons and form elements, adding a dynamic touch while keeping the focus on functionality.
        
        One of the most valuable aspects of this class was learning about user-centered design. By considering the needs of visitors and how they interact with the site, I created a clean, easy-to-navigate page that effectively conveys the mission of L & V. Additionally, I integrated accessibility features to ensure the page is usable by all visitors.

        To enhance the design further, I incorporated CSS animations to create subtle visual effects for the buttons and text, adding a dynamic touch without overwhelming the content. I also integrated images that represent both learning and vitality, giving visitors a visual sense of the organization’s purpose.
        
        This web design class has been pivotal to achieving my professional goals. The skills I’ve developed will allow me to design user-friendly, visually appealing websites, especially for organizations like L & V that aim to educate and empower others.</p>
